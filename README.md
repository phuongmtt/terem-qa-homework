# 📝 Mini To-Do App – Test Automation Challenge

This is a simple HTML+JS To-Do app built for automation test candidates. It has basic features like adding, completing, and deleting tasks. Your challenge is to write automated tests for this app using JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run the app in two ways:

#### Option A – Open Directly

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser.

#### Option B – Run on Local Server (Recommended for Automation)

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
npx serve
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve .
```

Then go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- Basic assertions
- A useful README

### 💡 Bonus
- Good selector strategy
- Test reusability
- Extra validations
- Production Checklist

## Evaluation Criteria
- Tooling best practice
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how you would structure a real-project
- Completeness: did you complete the requirements?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

## Deliverables
Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

## Submission
Please organisee, design and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the main branch. After you have completed everything please share a link with our Team.
